# Cryptography

This repository contains a collection of cryptographic algorithms and techniques implemented in Python. It covers basic encryption and decryption methods, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing algorithms, and digital signatures.

## Features

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Implementations of AES, DES, and more.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA algorithm for public-key encryption.
- **Hashing Algorithms**: SHA-256, MD5, and others for data integrity.
- **Digital Signatures**: Implementing signature generation and verification using RSA.
